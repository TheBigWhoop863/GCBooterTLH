GCBooter v1.0 by emu_kidid

Info:
This is a simple application which allows anyone to boot their original
GC games from Wii mode. It is region free and works from the homebrew channel.

This is far simpler to use than having to patch your system menu for region free :)

Usage: Just copy the GCBooter folder into your /apps/ folder on your card and run it via the homebrew channel.

Requirements:
Wii (with the ability to boot some Wii homebrew)
Gamecube Game
Gamecube Controller

Credits:
GCBooter is based on Bushing's code at http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?8,925
