GCBooterTLH v0.9 by thoughton
(A very-slightly modified version of: GCBooter v1.0 by emu_kidid)

Info:
This is a simple application which allows anyone to boot their original
GC games from Wii mode. It is region-free and works from the Homebrew Channel.

This is far simpler to use than having to patch your system menu for region free :)

(GCBooterTLH fixes the "red screen" problem when using PAL Wiis in 60hz mode.)

Usage:
Just copy the GCBooterTLH folder into your /apps/ folder on your SD card and run it via the Homebrew Channel.

Requirements:
Wii (with the ability to boot Wii homebrew)
Gamecube Game
Gamecube Controller
